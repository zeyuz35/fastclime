## 2024-05-18 - Direct boolean index assignment vs matrix multiplication masks
**Learning:** In R, replacing matrix elements via direct boolean index assignment (`mat[idx] <- other[idx]`) is significantly faster and more memory-efficient than creating boolean masks and multiplying them across the whole matrix (`mat * (mask) + other * (!mask)`). The latter calculates values for the entire dimensions repeatedly and allocates large intermediate matrices.
**Action:** Always prefer direct boolean indexing for element-wise conditional matrix replacement.
